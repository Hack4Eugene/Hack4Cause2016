What is slack?
slack is super cool, developer friendly team based messaging app. If you want an idea of the kind of things you can do with slack check out these examples: https://api.slack.com/community


This a basic node(Javascript) server that does two things
1. serves a basic html page with a form
2. responds to the submitting of said form

the form had one field that accepts text input. When set up correctly this input is posted in any slack group with the integration installed.


USAGE:
1. sign up or login to slack
2. add a web hook and enter you webhook url into the MY_SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL variable in app.js (https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks)
3. install node if necessary (https://nodejs.org/en/)
4. run 'node app.js' in your terminal

Getting help:
1. first check out the slack api documentation (https://api.slack.com/)
2. if you've never used express/node before checkout this tutorial: http://expressjs.com/starter/installing.html 
3. I'd be happy to help out, just tell the conference organizers you're looking for Nathan Pointer
