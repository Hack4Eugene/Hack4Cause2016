Installation
------------
Copy the Achievements Open Badges Bridge module directory to your modules 
directory and then enable on the admin modules page.  The Achievements 
module by Morbus Iff must already be enabled.  Create achievements as
instructed in the Achievements module, and make 'unlocked' achievement 
images use the .png format.  A 'badge' achievement image may also be
included to allow for larger resolution badges (e.g. 256x256).
