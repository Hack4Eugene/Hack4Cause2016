/**
 * @file
 * Hooks provided by the Achievements module and how to implement them.
 */

/**
 * Define an achievement.
 *
 * This hook describes your achievements to the base module so that it can
 * create the pages and caches necessary for site-wide display. The base
 * module doesn't know how to unlock any of your achievements... instead, you
 * use Drupal's existing hooks, the achievement storage tables, and a few
 * helper functions to complete the workflow. See the remaining documentation
 * in this file for further code samples.
 *
 * There are many different kinds of achievements, and it's accurate enough to
 * say that if you can measure or respond to an action, it can be made into a
 * matching achievement. Be creative. Look at what others are doing. Have fun.
 * Your gamification efforts will fail or be un-fun if you don't have a gamer
 * helping you, if you make everything a mindless grind, or if you simply
 * copy achievements from another site or install.
 *
 * @return
 *   An array whose keys are internal achievement IDs (32 chars max) and whose
 *   values identify properties of the achievement. These properties are:
 *   - title: (required) The title of the achievement.
 *   - description: (required) A description of the achievement.
 *   - points: (required) How many points the user will earn when unlocked.
 *   - images: (optional) An array of (optional) keys 'locked', 'unlocked',
 *     and 'secret' whose values are image file paths. Achievements exist in
 *     three separate display states: unlocked (the user has it), locked (the
 *     user doesn't have it), and secret (the user doesn't have it, and the
 *     achievement is a secret). Each state can have its own default image
 *     associated with it (which administrators can configure), or achievements
 *     can specify their own images for one, some, or all states.
 *   - storage: (optional) If you store statistics for your achievement, the
 *     core module assumes you've used the achievement ID for the storage
 *     location. If you haven't, specify the storage location here. This lets
 *     the core module know what to delete when an administrator manually
 *     removes an achievement unlock from a user. If your achievement
 *     tracks statistics that are NOT set with achievements_storage_get()
 *     or _set, you don't have to define the 'storage' key.
 *   - secret: (optional) The achievement displays on a user's Achievements
 *     tab but does not reveal its title, description, or points until the
 *     user has unlocked it. Compatible with 'invisible'.
 *   - invisible: (optional) The achievement does NOT display on a user's
 *     Achievements tab, but does show up on the leaderboards when necessary.
 *     Compatible with 'secret' (i.e., if another user has unlocked an
 *     invisible achievement, a user who has not unlocked it will see the
 *     placeholder secret text instead of the actual achievement itself).
 *   - manual-only: (optional) Set this to TRUE if the achievement has no
 *     automated way of being granted--meaning only a user with the `grant manual
 *     achievements` can grant the achievement (or take it away).
 *
 *   Achievements can also be categorized into groups. Groups are simply
 *   arrays whose keys are internal group IDs and whose values identify
 *   the 'title' of the group as well as the array of 'achievements' that
 *   correspond to that group. If some achievements are within a group and
 *   some achievements are without a group, the groupless achievements will
 *   automatically be placed into a "Miscellany" category.

function example_comment_insert($comment) {
  // Most achievements measure some kind of statistical data that must be
  // aggregated over time. To ease the storage of this data, the achievement
  // module ships with achievement_storage_get() and _set(), which allow you
  // to store custom data on a per-user basis. In most cases, the storage
  // location is the same as your achievement ID but in situations where you
  // have progressive achievements (1, 2, 50 comments etc.), it's better to
  // share a single place like we do below. If you don't use the achievement
  // ID for the storage location, you must specify the new location in the
  // 'storage' key of hook_achievements_info().
  //
  // Here we're grabbing the number of comments that the current commenter has
  // left in the past (which might be 0), adding 1 (for the current insert),
  // and then saving the count back to the database. The saved data is
  // serialized so can be as simple or as complex as you need it to be.

  // Note that we're not checking if the user has previously earned any of the
  // commenting achievements yet. There are two reasons: first, we might want
  // to add another commenting achievement for, say, 250 comments, and if we
  // had stopped the storage counter above at 100, someone who currently has
  // 300 comments wouldn't unlock the achievement until they added another 150
  // nuggets of wisdom to the site. Generally speaking, if you need to store
  // incremental data for an achievement, you should continue to store it even
  // after the achievement has been unlocked - you never know if you'll want
  // to add a future milestone that will unlock on higher increments.
  //
  // Secondly, the achievements_unlocked() function below automatically checks
  // if the user has unlocked the achievement already, and will not reward it
  // again if they have. This saves you a small bit of repetitive coding but
  // you're welcome to use achievements_unlocked_already() as needed.
