civi_bartik
==========

Civi Bartik is a wider, recolorable admin theme for CiviCRM based on
Drupal Core's Bartik theme. This theme is to be used mainly for
CiviCRM backend to get a clean/wider look of CiviCRM backend pages/form.

When using Bartik as CiviCRM admin theme, CiviCRM pages/forms gets
compressed because of the centered & narrow content area and the
pages/forms looks messy. This theme is a copy of Drupal Core's Bartik
theme, with some changes in the CSS for making CiviCRM backend
pages/form look cleaner by using the empty spaces on left/right
side of the main content area.

The CSS changes can be documented and done in Bartik theme,
but as Bartik is a core theme, i dont want the user to lose 
the changes during drupal upgrade. Hence releasing this
theme to cater for wider CiviCRM pages/forms without losing
it during drupal upgrade process.
